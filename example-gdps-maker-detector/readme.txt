Copy "gdps-maker.json" and paste it into your GDPS files, then change the variables inside it based on what your GDPS has.


Info about the variables:

"database-file": The file that links to your .sql file that later will be imported into your MySQL server by GDPS Maker.
"config-editor-file": The config file for MySQL credentials for your GDPS to connect to.
"config-editor-database-host": The variable inside your config file that will save the MySQL server's host server.
"config-editor-database-user": The variable inside your config file that will save the MySQL server's username.
"config-editor-database-pass": The variable inside your config file that will save the MySQL server's password.
"config-editor-database-name": The variable inside your config file that will save the MySQL server's database name.


NOTE: ONLY write inside the double quotes("") or you would get an error when GDPS Maker tries to detect your GDPS.
