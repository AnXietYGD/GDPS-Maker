# GDPS-Maker
GDPS Maker is a program written in Python to help you make your Geometry Dash Private Server(formerly known as GDPS) much easier.
# Why GDPS Maker?
- GDPS Maker can make both server-side of your GDPS and client-side
- GDPS only needs your credintals so you can sit back and relax while GDPS Maker creates your GDPS
- GDPS Maker has the GMDPrivateServer's files made by Cvolton already implemented so you won't need to download anything
# How do I use this?
