# GDPS-Maker
GDPS Maker is a program written in Python and PHP (along with a plethora of other languages coming soon) to help you make your Geometry Dash Private Server (also known as GDPS) much easier.
# Why GDPS Maker?
- GDPS Maker can make both server-side of your GDPS and client-side
- GDPS only needs your credentials so you can sit back and relax while GDPS Maker creates your GDPS
- GDPS Maker will automatically download Cvolton's [GMDPrivateServer](https://github.com/cvolton/gmdprivateserver) Repo, so you won't have to worry about cloning it.
# How do I use this?
You can head over to the releases tab, which can be found [here](https://github.com/electroflameofficial/GDPS-Maker/releases). Download any release you would prefer (I'd suggest using the latest release for more stability).

Lastly, special thanks to [@ToppLe](https://github.com/Intelligent-Cat) for allowing me to revive this phenomenal project.
